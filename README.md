```

## Task 1
To Create simplified recursive filter and compare its results with 1D Kalman filter
- Generate noisy 1D data,
- Demonstrate 1D Linear Kalman Filter estimation on data,
- Create simplified recursive filter and compare its results with 1D Kalman filter
- Play with different values for filter initialization (xOpt and eOpt) to prove the Filter convergence

## Task 2
Kalman Filter - Estimation of the traveled distance
- To predict the traveled distance based on the linear accelerometer measurement.
Update the predicted value using the distance measurements of the GPS sensor.
- Apply Kalman filter to predict the traveled distance and plot the graphs of the measured distance
(in meters) and the predicted distance (in meters)

## Description:
This Assignment is run by a single notebook file ```main.ipynb``` in the main folder.


### Local Setup

* Clone project using command:
